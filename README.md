## Description

_A website that lets the user play the board game "Mastermind". In this game the user is tasked with trying to solve a code that is generated by guessing which of the colors is correct. The game lets the user know how close they are by displaying different colored pegs, gold pegs means that the user now has a color and the correct position in place, a green/white peg means the user has a correct color. The game is over when either the player correctly guesses the pattern, or the users take more then the given turns to guess and lose._
